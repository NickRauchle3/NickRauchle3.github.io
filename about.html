    <div class="About">
        <p>
            Born in Orange County, California in 1999. Ended up moving to Houston, Texas when I was around the age of 6. I have happily
            lived here ever since. I played Football all my life until the age of 15 when I was a freshman in Highschool. I ended playing Lacrosse
            for the rest of my highschool time. I was in the talks for the All-American nomination until I broke my left collarbone snowboarding in Lake Tahoe, California.
            I graduated highschool at The Woodlands High School with an overall GPA of 3.6 finishing in the top 30% for my school.
